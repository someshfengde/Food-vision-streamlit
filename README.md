 ## intro : 
    I'm second year computer science student from APSIT, Thane, India 
    this is the project in which I've developed app where you can determine the numeber of food products seemlessly by just clicking picture 

    since the app is laucnched on the `www.streamlit.io` any user can use it without any setup 

    main advantage is since it's running on the streamlit server you can share it with anyone and everyone in the world can view my application
